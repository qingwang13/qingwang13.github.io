Research Interests:
------
My research is at the intersection of **Bayesian statistics, high-dimensional inference, and machine learning**, focusing on structured data such as tensors, networks, and multivariate time series. I develop **Bayesian tensor regression models** with **random projection–based dimension reduction** to enable scalable inference in complex settings. My theoretical work establishes **concentration inequalities and posterior consistency** under compression, providing guarantees for reliable uncertainty quantification, with applications in macro-finance and financial econometrics.

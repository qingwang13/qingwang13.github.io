Welcome to my website!

I'm a 4th year PhD student in Economics at Ca' Foscari University, with an interest in tensor regression, Bayesian inference and high-dimensional data analysis.

My advisors are Prof. Roberto Casarin from Ca' Foscari University and Prof. Radu Craiu from University of Toronto. 

I was a visiting PhD student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at University of Toronto from September 2023 to June 2024.

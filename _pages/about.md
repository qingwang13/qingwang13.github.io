Welcome!

I'm a PhD student and a research fellow at the Department of Economics at Ca' Foscari University. 

My research is at the intersection of **Bayesian statistics, high-dimensional inference, and machine learning**, focusing on structured data such as tensors, networks, and multivariate time series. 

I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Roberto Casarin from Ca' Foscari University and Prof. Radu Craiu from University of Toronto during my PhD study.

I was a visiting PhD student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at University of Toronto from September 2023 to June 2024.

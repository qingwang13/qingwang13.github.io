Welcome!

I'm a PhD student and a research fellow at the Department of Economics at Ca' Foscari University. My research interest lies in tensor regression, Bayesian inference and high-dimensional data analysis.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Roberto Casarin from Ca' Foscari University and Prof. Radu Craiu from University of Toronto during my PhD study.

I was a visiting PhD student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at University of Toronto from September 2023 to June 2024.
